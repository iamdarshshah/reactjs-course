## Dependencies

**Some things you'll need**:

- [ ] Node >= 8.10 & npm >= 5.6
- [ ] npm or yarn

> Note: we will be using `npx` for creating a react-app â€” [itâ€™s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).

That's pretty much it! ðŸ’¯
