- In a React component, `props` are variables passed to the child component by its parent component. `State` on the other hand are still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component itself, in which they are initialized.

- `props` are **immutable**. Whereas, `state` is **mutable**.

_Difference must be clear to you, as of now. But will cover some of the use-cases to explain when to use `props` & `state`._
