_Open the Terminal window & clone the repo_

#### 🏃 Steps to follow

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iamdarshshah/reactjs-course-app.git
cd reactjs-course-app
```

_Open up your **favorite** text Editor. I'll be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)_ 😃

- By-default you will be in `master` branch. You'll have to switch to `start` branch.

> 🌲 **branch**: `git checkout start`

🎉 That's all you need to get started with today's bootcamp. 🎉
