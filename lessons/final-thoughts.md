WooHoo!! we did it!! 🏆 &nbsp;&nbsp;Congrats! 🎊 &nbsp;&nbsp;

At this point, you have basic understanding of working with React and some of the react terminologies. I hope I could convey my excitement and love for this library and show you just how pleasant it is to develop with.

We are done with the Bootcamp session. I'll be taking a talk session today @7:30 pm IST. Will be covering `Routing` in React. Here is the link for the [Talk session](https://youtu.be/zbjEAwWpKMg).

🚀 See you all there!!
