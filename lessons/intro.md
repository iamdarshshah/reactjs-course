## 👨‍💻 Who Am I

![My GitHub profile](./images/image.png)

My name is Darsh Shah, Frontend developer @Upforce Tech. Since, after completing my high-secondary schooling I was into Tech as we had C++ as a programming language during those days. I love learning new technologies and build something on top of it. I have been part of many Hackathons globally as a Participant, Mentor & Judge.

I am part of many developer communities out there like Facebook developer circles, Google developers group, Google cloud developers communtiy and many more. Recently, two days back I earned a badge of "Student Expert Program" from [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). So, now I'm part of Postman's student developer program and will be taking session on working with Postman.

Outside of code, I love travelling to different parts of world and my goal is to explore as many places as I can (work is in progress!!). Apart from that, I like playing chess in my free time and LOVE to Dance 🕺. Recently, I've gotten into Mentoring & Judging different Hackathons happening globally. That's pretty much it, I can't share my address 😅 but, I currently live in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, with my family.
