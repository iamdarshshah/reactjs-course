## 👨‍💻 Who Am I

![Me eating Burger](./images/me.png)

My name is Darsh Shah, Frontend developer @Upforce Tech. I love learning new technologies and build something on top of it. I have been part of many Hackathons globally as a Participant, Mentor & Judge.

Outside of code, I want to travel the whole world and explore different dishes they serve over their. Really big into fitness, especially yoga, basketball, and calisthenics. I'm a rare sneaker collector that spends too much time looking for the next pair. Recently, I've gotten into Mentoring & Judging different Hackathons happening globally. I currently live in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, with my family.
